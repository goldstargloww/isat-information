                    <p>
                        welcome! this is a bunch of information about <a href="https://insertdisc5.com/">insertdisc5</a>'s game <a href="https://instarsandtime.com/">In Stars and Time</a>, and its prequel, <a href="https://insertdisc5.itch.io/start-again-prologue">START AGAIN START AGAIN START AGAIN: a prologue</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        this site will <i>not</i> avoid nor warn for spoilers for either game. i recommend completing ISAT and knowing about SASASAP as well as all optional content in both games before exploring this site.

                <h2>what kinds of information?</h2>
    
                    <p>
                        this is essentially trying to be some sort of documentation on ISAT and SASASAP, in a way. things like variables and items and style guides and visuals and that stuff. the <a href="/lists">lists</a> page has lists for variables, items, skills, and more, <a href="/formatting">formatting</a> will likely have things about how dialogue is formatted, <a href="/visuals">visuals</a> will have information about how to recreate visuals from the game, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        there's a lot of information about ISAT especially that i've gotten both out of my own curiosity and from working on the ISAT Script Project, some of which has been <i>incredibly</i> painful to figure out. a lot of reverse engineering, digging through code, and trial and error. i started making some references for myself to use, then realized that other people would probably benefit from it. for a while it was a series of markdown files on the ISATSP repository, then was moved to its wiki, and then i realized how incredibly painful github wikis are to work with and decided to move it to its own site. which is here! helo! waves!!!
