# isat information

> a wiki of sorts for in stars and time, but more on the technical side of things.

this is a bunch of information about [insertdisc5](https://insertdisc5.com)'s game [In Stars and Time](https://instarsandtime.com) which you should absolutely play right now if you haven't already, it's 100% the best story game i've ever played and has been living in my brain since the moment i started playing it. it might also end up containing information for its prequel, [START AGAIN START AGAIN START AGAIN: a prologue](https://insertdisc5.itch.io/start-again-prologue).

note that this repository will *not* avoid spoilers, nor will it warn for them outside of this blanket statement!

# other projects you should check out

- [felikatze](https://github.com/felikatze)'s [ISAT Script Project](https://github.com/felikatze/isat-script-project) is amazing and i've helped a lot with it myself! go check it out, he's compiled a lot of dialogue from the game, and as he says this site is his baby. go look at it it's great
- [kongkrog](https://github.com/kongkrog)'s [isat profile customizer](https://github.com/kongkrog/isat-profile-customizer) does a great job at recreating visuals from the game in both html/css and javascript generated images and gifs (it's seriously really cool, i would make something like this if i knew how to do javascript lol)
- does the [ISATwiki](https://instarsandtime.wiki.gg/wiki/In_Stars_and_Time_Wiki) count? if you're looking for story information, gameplay information, anything that isn't the tiny specific details in the game's code that make it work, go here. tons of people work on it and it's a good source of information
